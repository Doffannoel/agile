    <h1>Agile Project Management</h1>

    <p class="section-title">Course Description</p>
    <p>
        This course focuses on the foundational principle of agile paradigm for developing a software.
        Two agile methodologies, i.e., the Kanban and Scrum methodologies, will be mainly discussed throughout the course.
        Students will be asked to work in a group to develop a simple, working software that follows the agile methodologies.
        Upon approval, the instructor can, for example, act as a stakeholder, and the students act as a scrum team.
        And, the scrum team will be asked to demonstrate their understandings of the agile principles.
        During the process, a software tool will be used to help students to collaborate and implement the agile methodologies.
