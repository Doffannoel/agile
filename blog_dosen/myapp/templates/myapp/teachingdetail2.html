    <h1>Creativity and Technological Innovation</h1>

    <p class="section-title">Course Description</p>
    <p>
        This course introduces students to the concept of creativity and structured approach of innovation in technology-driven context. It combines both analytical and
creative thinking aiming at producing new solutions for a wide range of technical and social problems. It exposes students to the essential mental models, mindsets,
behaviours, tools and techniques necessary to foster creativity and innovation in individuals and teams. A central theme of this course is that creativity, as an
important ingredient to innovation, can be enhanced through learning, imagining, combining ideas, or reframing problems. To be innovative, one should go beyond
just creative. He / she must understand the market dynamics and suitable technology as instruments for delivering real value to the society. As such, the course
is structured to encourage students exploring various creative approaches and applying them innovatively in responding to real-world challenges. In addition to
classroom activities, students will work collaboratively in cross-disciplinary teams to design technologically-viable and economically-sustainable solutions.
